# Secure-Share
SecureShare is a web-based file-sharing platform prototype built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a login page (email/password or social login placeholders) and a dashboard with a sidebar and sample file list. The "Share" button generates fake URLs, simulating secure sharing.
