SecureShare is a web-based file-sharing platform aimed at securely uploading, managing, and sharing files with a focus on privacy and integrity. This prototype, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offers a basic frontend. The login page allows users to sign in via email/password or social providers (placeholders), redirecting to a dashboard upon submission. The dashboard features a sidebar with navigation options ("Dashboard," "My Files," etc.) and a file list displaying sample files (e.g., "Project Proposal.pdf") with details like size and type. Clicking "Share" generates a fake URL, simulating secure sharing. HTML structures the pages, CSS styles them with a clean layout using flexbox and custom designs, and JavaScript handles form submission and URL generation.

This prototype lays the groundwork for a secure file-sharing tool, focusing on UI and basic interactivity as per the provided document.
